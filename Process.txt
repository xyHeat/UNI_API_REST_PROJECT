1. Creating Public Repository.
I used my existing account, and created a repository named "UNI_API_REST_PROJECT".

2. Using Github help to push a node .gitignore file.
To create the wanted file, I used the file named 'Node.gitignore' located in the provided github link.

3. Pushing existing content to github.
> git init
Initialising our git folder

> git remote add origin https://github.com/xyHeat/UNI_API_REST_PROJECT.git
Creating remote link

> git add .
Adding our .gitgnore file

> git commit -m "Commit 1"
Creating a commit with the name "Commit 1"

> git push -u origin master
Sending our commit to the remote link.

4. Creating a new 'dev' Branch
> git pull origin master
Update our local repository

> git checkout -b dev
Create a local branch and switch to it

5. Sending our rest api
Note: I used the provided zip file, where I renamed "myapp" to "src".

> git add .
Adding new files

> git commit -m "Commit 2"
Creating Commit

> git push origin dev
Sending our commit to the dev branch.

6. Creating README.md
Including the following text:
"Expressjs and Knex.js web service that performs CRUD operations against a MySQL database." 

7. Pushing created README File
> git add .
Adding new files

> git commit -m "Commit 3"
Creating Commit

> git push origin dev
Sending our commit to the dev branch.

8. Merging our master and dev branches
Since "pull-request" isn't a git command (win10), we have to do it on the github project page.

> git switch master
Going back to our origin branch

> git merge dev
Merging dev into our local master branch

> git add .
Adding new files

> git push origin master
Applying the merge.
